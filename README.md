# K-Mix_RemoteScript
This repository will store all of the python files for the MIDI Remote Script integrating the K-Mix with Ableton Live. Feel free to request features, and report bugs. 

As of version 1.1, I rebuilt most of the script. I will be leaving ver 1.0 up, but will not be updating that folder going forward. 

This script will work (for now) with the out of the box MIDI settings for the K-Mix in MIDI bank 1. You simply need to place the K_Mix_ver_X_X folder into your MIDI remote scripts directory.
