# K-Mix_RemoteScript
This repository will store all of the python files for the MIDI Remote Script integrating the K-Mix with Ableton Live. Please edit the 'Bugs' or 'Features' text files to report issues or request features.  

This script will work (for now) with the out of the box MIDI settings for the K-Mix in MIDI bank 1. You simply need to place the K_Mix folder into your MIDI remote scripts directory. We are still waiting for LED feedback, but that should be coming soon!
