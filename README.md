## K-Mix_RemoteScript
This repository will store all of the python files for the MIDI Remote Script integrating the K-Mix with Ableton Live. Please edit the 'Bugs' or 'Features' text files to report issues or request features. I am only one man, working on this when I can so bear with me! 

This script will work (for now) with the out of the box MIDI settings for the K-Mix. You simply need to place the K_Mix folder into your MIDI remote scripts directory. We are still waiting for LED feedback, but that should be coming soon!
